# Cool Notes
Why is it called "Cool" Notes? Go find out: https://nes-cool-notes.netlify.app/

## Why would you build this?
I like vanilla JavaScript and it's been a while since I don't work without any library.

## What was interesting?
These components are really encapsulated and I think that's pretty cool. It's kind of painful to update a parent component from its child, but it was nice to learn the logic for it.

It's also interesting to identify the building blocks of React and Stimulus. You can see the places where it's similar and the places where these libraries made improvements. Web components is like reading the book whereas React is like watching the movie.

## How do I even run this?
Just clone the repo and open index.html on your browser. If it's causing issues, maybe it's because of the file names. At first I was using lower-case for components, but then I changed them for upper-case. I can't see these changes on GitHub though, not sure why.
